WPC Mystery Box allows you to sell boxes that contain randomly products.

== Description ==

**WPC Smart Mystery Box** is a brand-new way of grouping selective or random products in your online store and selling them as a surprise box to customers, in which they are unknown of what they will receive until the box is opened.

**WPC Smart Mystery Box** allows users to put multiple products from different sources as assortments of the box and arrange them to craft an irresistible offer. With the added sense of surprised delight, customers are encouraged to purchase the mystery box to get one or more items from the list as the rewards for taking the risk of purchasing such blind packages. Mystery boxes emphasize on the psychology of human curiosity, imagination, and excitement, thus, they can increase the conversion rate for your business.

By cross-bundling fast-moving products or exclusive items with slow-moving or excess inventory ones into mystery boxes, sellers can reduce the burden of inventory costs, convert more visitors into potential customers while still boosting the sales and order values at the same time. Well-planned mystery boxes also facilitate in boosting organic brand visibility and social proof among current customers.
